  <div id="services">
    <p class="font-cursive">
      A help desk is a tool that organizes customer communication to help
      businesses respond to customers and support them more quickly and
      effectively. Using a help desk allows your support team to offer the best
      possible service experience to your customers. HelpDesk offer feature to
      provide context and insight into customer experiences. They also offer
      eatures that allow you to benchmark the performance of your support team,
      ensuring that your team is truly efficient in assisting and delighting
      customers. HelpDesk tools are one of the most integral tools for
      successfully supporting a customer base and delivering effortless customer
      service. If you provide support on multiple communication channels such as
      email, phone, live chat, messaging channels, or social media, having a
      helpdesk will allow you to unify all support channels into one place.
      There is nothing more frustrating to a customer than starting in one
      place(such as chat or phone) and being shuffled around from one channel to
      the other, repeating themselves to get an answer. Having a helpdesk app
      allows you to give a seamless omnichannel experience to your customers by
      retaining context when a customer switches channel.
